## Exercise 1
**How would you generalize this game with arbitrary value of $m_1$ (minimum increment), $m_2$ (maximum increment), and $N$ (the winning number)? **


\begin{itemize}
\item $m_{1} = 1$
\item $m_{2} = 2$
\item $N = 31$
\end{itemize}

\newpage
## Exercise 2
**Two players are to play a game. The two players take turns to call out integers. The rules are as follows. Describe A’s winning strategy.**










\newpage
## Exercise 3
**There is only finite number of deterministic stationary policy. How many is it?**

\
\vspace{30pt}

Answer is $|\pi|=|A|^{|S|}$ ($length\ of\ policy\ matrix^{finite \ numer}$)


\newpage
## Exercise 4
**Formulate the first example in this lecture note using the terminology including state, action, reward, policy, transition. \\ Describe the optimal policy using the terminology as well.**



A and B are to play a game. They take turn to call out integers. \\
1. The serving player must call out an integer between 1 or 2. \\
2. The opponent player 1) takes the other player’s number and 2) increments it by 1 or 2, then 3) call out the number. \\
3. Keep playing back and forth until someone calling out the number 31. The person calling out 31 is winner.

\begin{itemize}
\item State = $1\le S_{t} \le 31\ \& S_{t}\ is\ intger$
\item $a_{1}$ is increased by 1
\item $a_{2}$ is increased by 2

\begin{center}
Reward

\begin{itemize}
\item $If\ S_{t} == 31$ reward is 100
\item otherwise 0

Transition

$P_{ss'}^a = P(S_{t+1} = S' \mid S_t = s, A_t = a) =1$

## Exercise 5
**From the first example**
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume that your opponent increments by 1 with prob 0.5 and by 2 with prob 0.5
\item Assume that the winning number is 0 instead of 31
\item your opponent played first and she called out 1
\item your current a policy $\pi_{0}$ is that
\begin{itemize}
\item if the current state s \le 5 then increment by 2
\item if the current state s > 5 then increment by 1
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

**Evaluate $V^{\pi_{0}}(1)$ **

$S_{1} = 1$

while $S_{t} \le 10$


\quad P = random Prob

\quad if P > 0.5 

\qquad $S_{t}=S_{t}+1$

\quad elif P \le 0.5

\qquad $S_{t}=S_{t}+2$

\quad If $S_{t}==10$ # when you lose


\qquad return 0

\quad If $S_{t}\le 5$

\qquad $S_{t+1}=S_{t}+2$

\quad If $S_{t} > 5$

\qquad $S_{t+1}=S_{t}+1$

\quad If $S_{t}$ == 10 # when you win

\qquad return 1
