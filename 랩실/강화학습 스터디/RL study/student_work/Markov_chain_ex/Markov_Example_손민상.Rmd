# Effect of advertisement for new product

\vspace{20pt}

## Introduction 
When the company decide whether they advertise some product or not, they compare the effect of the advertisement. And if they do not have a promotion for the product, the product will lose its popularity. The effect of the advertisement is also decided by the type of the advertisement.

## Problem

MS company release new product and plan to promote for this product. There are three choices: Youtube advertisement, SNS advertisement, do nothing. State 1 means the people who do not know the product or be willing to buy the product; 2 means the people who sometimes buy the product; 3 means regular customers. The diagram for each effect is below. Make an optimal policy.

\begin{itemize}
\item $State=S=\{1,2,3\}$
\item $Reward\,\,\,\,\,R(1)=0\,, R(2)=100\,, R(3)=1000$
\end{itemize}

If advertisement cost and number of customers are given, we can make a optimal problem. and we also have to think about advertising using both Youtube and SNS in same time. I think it need to think about differcy of results from different duration.
