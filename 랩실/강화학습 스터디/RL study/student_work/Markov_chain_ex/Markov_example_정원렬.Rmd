# Effect of Exercise policy for muscle growth 

\vspace{20pt}

## Introduction 

**A student who likes to exercise decided to make a strategy for his lower body muscle growth. There are two exercises. First is squat and second is deadlift. If he Squats, he get guaranteed a low injury rate but his muscle grow slowly. However, If he Deadlift, he has a high probability of injury but his muscle grow fast.  He have to calculate optimal exercise strategy for maximum muscle growth with optimal effort. As a result, two actions could be defined:**

## Problem Formulation



\begin{itemize}
\item $State=S=\{1,2,3,.....\}$
\item Action $A = \{Squat, DeadLift\}$
\item Squat's Transition Prob $\{ 0.9,0.1\}$
\item DeadLift's Transition Prob $\{ 0.7,0.3\}$
\item $Reward\,\,\,\,\,R(Squat_{Success})=1.5\ , R(Squat_{Failed} = -1),R(DeadLift_{success}),R(DeadLift_{failed})=1 $
\end{itemize}

**Use the Markov chain temperamental difference trait to establish a movement strategy.**
